=head1 NAME

use-devel-assertos - a script to package Devel::AssertOS modules
with your code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script, when run in the directory in which your shiny new module
lives, will bundle whichever Devel::AssertOS modules you ask it to
in the C<inc> directory, and update your Makefile.PL (or Build.PL)
appropriately.  If neither exists, it will create a Makefile.PL.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ./use-devel-assertos NetBSD OpenBSD FreeBSD

=head1 USAGE

In the example above, this will insert code to make your module
depend on one of the specified OSes.

=head1 WARNINGS, BUGS and FEEDBACK

This script has not been thoroughly tested.  You should check by
hand that it has done what you expected after running it.

If you use Module::Build::Compat to write a Makefile.PL, then you
will need to re-run this script whenever you have generated a new
Makefile.PL.

I welcome feedback about my code, including constructive criticism.
Bug reports should be made using L<http://rt.cpan.org/> or by email.
